Useful commands:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=PTS/60" output.mkv
ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v "crop=1900:1080:0:20" out.mp4
ffmpeg -i output.mkv -vcodec libx264 -crf 32 output.mp4
```

I not have adobe photoshop or photo editor software, so I use only a online editor And it's really good.
